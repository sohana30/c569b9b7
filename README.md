## Summary

The goal of this test is to make you code a small ReactJS app. We have prepared a skeleton app for you, but feel free to change anything (CSS files, HTML structure, JS structure, etc) to suit your needs.

The app should have the following features:
- **Activity Feed** - simple list of calls
- **Activity Detail** - detail of a call
- **Archive** - the final user should be able to archive (and unarchive) a call. Archived calls will no longer be displayed on the Activity Feed and should have a separate Archived Tab.
- A button to archive all calls in the activity feed
- A button to unarchive all calls in the archived calls tab



## Installation

We're using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) here (but you can use npm):

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

**Note**: Please make sure to run the app in Node 16.
